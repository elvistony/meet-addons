### Google Meet with Attendance Tracking (No Extra Popups or Confusions)
- Scans the chats to gather roll numbers that are mentioned.
- One Person can have only one roll number.
- One click export to announce the final attendance status (List of Roll numbers)
  - Useful for (VAST Faculty - to collect roll numbers for the ERP, easily!) 
- Under Construction


Issues:
 - Permanant installation requires you to use third-party plugins like CustomJavascript and Tampermonkey.
     - (workaround) Copy & paste the function code into the Page - Console
     - (another workaround) Save JS Script as a bookmark
